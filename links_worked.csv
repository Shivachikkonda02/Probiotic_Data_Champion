in the background red lilly logo animation appears on screen on a white background video shows scenes of the hills and trees of southern california  video shows a woman playing piano  then flashes to black and white photos showing her parents wedding and her childhood myra i absolutely love music my family is from cuba  and they were cuban immigrants  but i was born in the us and it was a household filled with music there are so many beautiful cuban songs that my mother would be singing it was just a lovely growingup time  a woman stands in her home  holding sheet music  singing in spanish we then hear her speaking over the music myra im myra solano garcia  myra is speaking to the camera  with colorful windows in the background myra  and i am living with alzheimers disease  classical piano music plays in the background as a photo of myra singing on stage appears myra for so many people  theyre so afraid of being on stage but for me  it has always been so natural i had opportunities   the music continues  and the video cuts to myra speaking to the camera a title appears with myra solano garcia  living with alzheimers myra  to travel across the country and just enjoy the power of music  a man sitting at a piano speaks to the camera a title appears with shawn kirchner  composer  songwriter and publisher the video shows myra singing a duet at church as he speaks shawn myra had a really big career back east as a soloist so when she first arrived  we were so excited  and we worked with her a lot as a featured soloist but more recently  i remember one choir practice thinking the question shes asking  describing the page number  the measure number  is just not computing and it didnt make any sense to me once we had the diagnosis of alzheimers  then im like  oh  my gosh but i mean  all things withstanding  its just fantastic that were able to work with her and that shes contributing so much  myra sits at a table in her living room  looking through old photos we see photos fade in and out on screen as she speaks myra this photo is from when i was just hired at the university of laverne as a vice president i looked a lot younger then i wonder why the first two years  i felt were very strong years it was about the third year when things started not feeling right  and i went to different neurologists and they would say  no  youre fine you have add  myra is speaking to the camera myra and to be honest  i was thrilled  because i really feared that it was going to be alzheimers disease  more photos of myra myra when i finally got the alzheimers diagnosis  i was relieved because i knew that i was still having cognitive problems a neuropsychiatrist encouraged me to enter a clinical trial  and im so very grateful  myra is in her home singing someone to watch over me we see photos of myra and her husband we then see myra driving in the car and running in her neighborhood myra speaking my husband takes great care of me we have a lot of fun on the weekends we get in the car  and we just go traveling throughout california not too long ago  we did a k race i came in second place in my age group  myra is speaking to the camera myra while i have alzheimers disease  i can no longer do numbers i have difficulty with names  but i can still sing  we hear myra singing amazing grace while the camera shows an exterior shot of a continuing care center near her home we then see myra singing to a person in the memory unit at the center and continuing to sing amazing grace myra i volunteer at a continuing care organization  singing with the memory unit residents  and i am fully cognizant that im going to be following in their paths but in the meantime  it just brings me joy you can see that theyre confused  but we start singing  and so many of them know all the words i think that that is the power of music  shawn is speaking to the camera we then see shots of myra smiling while volunteering in the memory care unit shawn music  they say lights up so many areas of the brain  and so it makes total sense that myra feels at home  despite whatever is going on with her diagnosis music is with us to the end  a choir sings as the camera shows the exterior of a church the video shows myra singing as part of her church choir myra im so grateful i found a church community that really sings to my soul i love singing and i love bringing music to others were all going to go at some point in time and if i go via alzheimers disease  it is what it is  the video shows myra looking at old photos  driving  pulling trash cans into her garage  reading while sitting on her couch  and then shows her again speaking to the camera myra because i can still do things that are important to me  i can drive  i can take care of the house i can read im going to focus on those  and im not going to focus on the things that i cant do so im not afraid  myra is on her back porch  looking to the sky  with her garden in the background myra im just living life and loving life  music fades out in the background the red lilly logo appears and fades on a white background another way to get select lilly medicinesyoure
